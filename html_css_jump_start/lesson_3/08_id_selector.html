            <h2>Eagles</h2>

            <p> Eagles probably first evolved from kites some 36 million years ago.
                The eagle has served as a very common symbol of strength and power in many human cultures. 
                They have adorned the national emblems of Rome/Byzantium, Russia, and many Germanic states. 
                The unusual-looking double-headed eagle is a common historical motif that may stretch back to the time of ancient Mesopotamia.
                The grip of the bald eagle is actually 10 times stronger than a human.
                Despite their much smaller bodyweight, the eye of an eagle is about the same size as a human eye.
                Eagles undergo a process called molting in which they gradually lose their feathers one at a time and grow completely new ones about every year. 
                Some species will lose feathers equally on both sides to maintain proper balance.
                Eagles can carry up to four times their own body weight, making it one of the strongest birds in the world.</p>

            <h2>Lions</h2>
            <p>
                Between 1993-2014, the IUCN estimated the population of lions decreased by 42%. 
                Due to poaching and habitat loss, its estimated there may be fewer than 20,000 lions left today.
                While lions are generally social animals, prides generally consist of 80% females. 
                For this reason, only about one in eight male lions survive to adulthood. 
                Groups of male lions sometimes band together, controlling vast swaths of territory. 
                One famous band of male lions in South Africa’s Kruger National Park controlled over 170,000 acres and was estimated to kill more than 100 rival lions and cubs. 
                Lions are animals that have long been kept in zoos and in captivity. 
                In 18th century England, the price of admission to the Tower Menagerie (the pre-cursor to the London Zoo) was three pence, or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions!
                The lion is considered one of the “African Big Five.”

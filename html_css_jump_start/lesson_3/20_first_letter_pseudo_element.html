            <p> Coyote (Canis latrans) is a species of canine native to North America. 
                It is smaller than its close relative, the wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. 
                It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia. 
                The coyote is larger and more predatory and was once referred to as the American jackal by a behavioral ecologist. 
                Other historical names for the species include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf. </p>

                The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, 
                due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America. 
                Coyote populations are also abundant southwards through Mexico and into Central America. 
                The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans. 
                It is enlarging its range by moving into urban areas in the eastern U.S. and Canada. 
                The coyote was sighted in eastern Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in 2013.

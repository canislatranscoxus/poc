            <p> 
                The grip of the bald eagle is actually <span class="emphasis" > 10 times stronger </span>than a human.
                Despite their much smaller bodyweight, the eye of an eagle is about the same size as a human eye.
                Eagles can carry up to four times their own body weight, making it <span class="emphasis" > one of the strongest birds in the world</span> .</p>

            <h2>Lions</h2>
            <p>
                While lions are generally social animals, prides generally consist of 80% females. 
                For this reason, only about one in eight male lions survive to adulthood. 
                In 18th century England, the price of admission to the Tower Menagerie 
                (the pre-cursor to the London Zoo) <span class="emphasis" > was three pence, or a cat or dog </span> to be fed to the lions!
                The lion is considered one of the “African Big Five.”
